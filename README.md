# JavaProjectUsingInheritance
===== Java Program using Inheritance ====
Description:
 This program creates a superclass (Customer) and 2 subclasses (Services & Supplies) using the concept of inheritance. It creates an arraylist <object> type of as many objects as the user wants and prints them in a clean formatted way.
 It also checks for input validation and gives the user an option to create either services or supplies objects.
 
How does it work?
The user is given a menu option to choose either 1 or 2 to create the objects.
It then askes for all the required attributes of the classes. <i.e Customer name, DOB, cust #, Services/Supplies 2 attributes depending on the selection>
It then asks to create another object. The user repeats the process if they say "yes" otherwise the programs ends with displaying the output of the objects created in a human readable manner.

Files needed:
Customer.java
Supplies.java
Services.java
Driver.java

SETUP-
To run the program, please have JVM installed! 

This program is created as part of a class assignment to demontrate the understanding of Java classes, their inheritance, and Arraylist concepts.
